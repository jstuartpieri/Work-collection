# Project 5) AWS truepower API wind characterists batch run extraction, processing and Analyssis

This project was done to marketing intelligence GE Renewable Energy team and it's confidential, so code and image previas can not be disclosed.

* AWS truepower API wind characteristics extraction in monthly scope using theirs API -- was used Python to batch run several sites at once -- text file used to store params needed to include as headers in POST method (used to feed batch run inputs).
* Data processing and data wrangling to prepare data to be ingested in Tableau along many other internal datasets.
* Tableau ensembling to give a global viz of wind onshore characteristics using AWS truepower wind data.

# Project 6) LATAM onshore wind Marketing Analysis (Tableau vizualization)

* Using multiple datasets some API extracted others GE internal was created a vizualization to cover some LATAM onshore wind marketing analytics.
* Covered analytics were:
  * Prospect and wind resources, Region Overview, Competitive Landscape, Customer Overview, OEM Selection, Turbines Selection.
  
 

# Project 7) MongoDB localhost configuration to store scrapped rotten tomatoes movies data

* Scrapped Rotten Tomatoes data and exported in JSON format.
* Configured a localhost MongoDB server using 2 shards, each with 3 replicasets to store data extracted.
* Imported rotten tomatoes JSON formatted extracted data to MongoDB shards.
